        <h1>Text Alignment</h1>
        <h2>"text-align:justify;"</h2>
        <p>When the justify property is used, each line is streched so that every line has equal width and the left and right margins are justified; as it has been implemented in the aside elements below.
        </p>
        <aside>
            In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'
        </aside>
        <h2>"text-align-last"</h2>

            Religious beliefs: The religious beliefs I hold can be influenced by mass media and religious leaders, sometimes making me less tolerant of other religions and more prone to being dogmatic.
            Social media use: I find myself spending more time on social media, and this can lead to addiction and distort my perception
